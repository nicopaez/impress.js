About this project
==================

It's a impress.js fork that contains some additional styles and guidance to use the framework. The guidance here is based on my own experience with the tool.

It is based on the impress.js v 0.3 and if you are already using impress.js you can use the features provided here just by adding a reference to the extensions.css.
